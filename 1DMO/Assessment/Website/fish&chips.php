                A simple but fantastic dish, fish & chips is exactly what it says it is. Usually served with tartar sauce or tomato sauce, coleslaw, and a slice of lemon, fish & chips are simply delicious.

                Although a fabulous dish, the quality can be affected by the vendor. If you get soggy chips and sub-par fish, a great dish can be turned into a gross affair.

                I rate fish & chips at 4/5 stars.
