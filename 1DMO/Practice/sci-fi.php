            'Saturn Run' begins with an intern discovering a possible alien craft decelerating towards Saturn. This sparks a 'race to Saturn' with America trying to beat China to the ringed planet (and any possible alien technology).

            The story is fast moving and compelling. The characters are well developed and as a reader I became quite invested in their personal stories. Whilst the book took quite a while to read, the journey was worth while. The Physics underlying the novel has been well researched and this helps to make the story both interesting and believable.

            The tight plot kept me engaged throughout and the author also used the story as a way of exploring politics, science and ultimately what it means to be human. It was a relief to see that the authors shied away from some of the cliches typically found in this genre and the result was a well crafted novel that appeals to a wide audience.
